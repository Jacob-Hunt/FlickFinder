      <h3>How to use FlickFinder:</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Sign up for an account.  Note that, at this point, you won't receive a confirmation email (or any other kind of
          notification that your sign-up was successful), but if you're redirected to the front-page login, your sign up
          was probably successful.  If you were redirected to the registration page, your sign up was probably unsuccessful.
          If in doubt, try logging in and see what happens.
        </li><br />
        <li>
          Log in.
        </li><br />
        <li>
          Click or tap on "Add Friends"
        </li><br />
        <li>
          Send a friend request to someone you want to watch a movie with.  Note that, if you send a friend request using
          a friend's email address, this will not spam their email folder, and the friend request will only be sent if
          they already have a FlickFinder account.  If your friend has sent you a friend request, click/tap on "Reply to Friend
          Requests" and accept their friend request.
        </li><br />
        <li>
          Click or tap on the FlickFinder logo in the upper-left corner to return to the front menu.  Note that, while I
          am planning on adding a "back" button at some point in the near-future, clicking on the FlickFinder logo is the
          only way to go back right now.
        </li><br />
        <li>
          Click or tap on New Movie Night button.
        </li><br />
        <li>
          Select your friend's name from the dropdown menu that comes up.  Click on "Invite" if you want to watch a movie
          with them.  Repeat this process for as many friends as you want (for instance, if you're planning on watching
          a movie with a group of friends).  Click "Next" when you're done.
        </li><br />
        <li>
          Select the genres to include in the movie search.  Note that, at this point, the search will only return movies
          that include all the genres you've selected (for example, selecting "Animated" and "Documentaries" will only
          return animated documentaries, and not animated films which are not documentaries or documentaries which are
          not animated); this is a bug which I am hoping to fix in the near future.  Click "Next" when you're done selecting.
        </li><br />
        <li>
          Have your friend(s) go to the front page and click/tap on "My Movie Nights."  They can then select the FlickFinder session
          from the menu that comes up.  They should then click or tap on "Go."
        </li><br />
        <li>
          Everyone in your group will be shown movie suggestions, along with descriptions of the movies and related information.
          You can then click or tap "Thumbs Up" or "Thumbs Down" to indicate weather or not you would be interested in watching
          the movie.  Note that clicking/tapping on "View Results" does nothing at this point.
        </li><br />
        <li>
          When everyone in your group wants to watch the same thing, FlickFinder will notify you.  Note that, at this point,
          only the last person to vote "Thumbs Up" will be notified (though I am hoping to change this in the near future).
        </li><br />
        <li>
          Continue rating movies if you feel like it.  Every time there's a match, the last person to vote "Thumbs Up" will
          be notified.  Note that, if you run through all the movies in your search results, the app will stop working, but
          you can click on the FlickFinder logo in the upper-right corner to refresh the app and start a new movie night.
        </li><br />
        <li>
          That's it for now!  This app is still very much a work-in-progress.  There are important features (such as being
          able to change your password or delete your account) which I have not yet added.  You will likely encounter
          strange bugs, and I can't promise that your account won't mysteriously delete itself (or, more likely, get accidentally
          deleted when I update the app's codebase).  You can email me at jacobhuntgit@gmail.com with any questions or bug
          reports.  Happy watching!
