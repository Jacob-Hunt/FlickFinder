      <h3>About FlickFinder</h3>

      <p>
         I wrote this app as my final project for Harvard University's
         <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">
         CS50 (introduction to computer science)</a> massive-open-online-course.  The main
         idea behind it is to alleviate the awkward and (at times) frustrating situation of
         wanting to watch a movie with one or more people, but being unable to agree on what to watch.
         It uses a similar design to the swipe-right/swipe-left mechanic employed by some
         dating apps, but with a focus on picking a movie to watch (as opposed to
         finding a date).
      </p>

      <p>
         I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this app, but for now I'm hosting a live
         demo of it as I continue to develop it, with the hope that others will find it
         useful.
      </p>

      <p>
         Also, I'm currently looking for a job in programming, web-design, or a similar field.
         If you like my app and think you could use my skills, please feel free to contact me 
         at jacobhuntgit@gmail.com.
      </p>

      <p>
         Peace, love, and penguins,<br />
