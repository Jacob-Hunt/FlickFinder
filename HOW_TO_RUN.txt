HOW TO RUN:

1. Get an api key from The Movie DB.  Instructions for this can be found 
   here: https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api?language=en

2. Go into apiKey.py and replace "<ENTER API KEY HERE>" with your api key

3. Go into config.py and replace "<ADD SECRET KEY HERE>" with a long
   string of random characters (a random string generator is recommended
   for this).

4. Replace the main body of privacypolicy.htm with your privacy policy.

5. Run locally using the command "python3 application.py".  If you wish
   to deploy a mirror of FlickFinder on the internet, contact your
   hosting service for instructions on how to deploy a Python Flask
   app with them.  Note that, at present, FlickFinder will not run
   properly on Heroku (though this should change once I migrate from
   SQLite3 to a more deployment-friendly database framework).  I have
   found FlickFinder to run reliably on PythonAnywhere
   (https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) thus far.
