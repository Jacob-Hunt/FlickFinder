I wrote this app as my final project for Harvard University's CS50 (introduction to computer science) massive-open-online-course.  It uses a similar design to the swipe-right/swipe-left mechanic employed by some dating apps, but with a focus on picking a movie that everyone can agree on (as opposed to finding a date).
